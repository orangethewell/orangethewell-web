## 📖 TL;DR

Feel free to fork this repository or clone it and use for your porposes. This contains a lot of boilerplate code that can help you quickstart a larger project. Take a look on _[Leptos Documentation](https://book.leptos.dev/)_ for more details about the technical working of this project.

I don't think you will need to touch _Axum_, but if it's needed, take a look on it's [docs](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) too.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies 
This project is written using _Rust_ programming language. But there's a lot of things running on background!

- 🖥️ **Frontend**: [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/)
- ⚙️ **Backend**: [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
- 🔒 **Session Management**: [Redis](https://redis.io/) (using [Redis-rs](https://github.com/redis-rs/redis-rs))
- 📁 **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (using [SeaORM](https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/))
- 🐳 **Containerization and Integration**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- ↪️ **Reverse Proxy**: [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
- 🧰 **Deployment**: [Github Actions](https://github.com/orangethewell/orangethewell-web/actions) with SSH

## 📙 Motivation

This website was created as a personal blog and as a test to improve my knowledge both with _Rust_ technologies like _Leptos_ and _Axum_, and with website server management, since before this project I was using a panel to handle everything together, and it wasn't working as expected.

After some studies, I got everything working. And now, I expect to write some articles about technology on this blog.

## 🌐 Internationalization

For sort, I plan internationalizing both posts and the website itself to English and Portuguese. If you think that some article is helpful and should be translated to another language, create a [new issue](https://github.com/orangethewell/orangethewell-web/issues/new/choose) to let us discuss about it. 

OBS: Check if there isn't anyone already working with the post you want to another language.

## ✈️ Discussions and References
All the things I post on this blog are completely free, you can mention and discuss about it on another site **if you leave the original post link on yours**. And of course, send me an email with your post so I can read it too. 😄
